# Quantium-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Internship
Data analysis project for the Quantium Virtual Internship on Forage.

Welcome to my internship project repository! This repository contains all the work completed during my remote internship at Quantium as a data analyst. The main focus was to analyze retail store sales data and provide actionable insights through data analytics and visualization.

## Project Overview

The objective of this internship was to analyze sales and customer transaction data from multiple retail stores during a specified trial period. The aim was to identify any significant differences in store performance metrics between trial stores and control stores, and provide recommendations to inform strategic planning.

Key highlights:
- Analysis focused primarily on the **trial period** (Feb 2019 – Apr 2019).
- Compared total sales revenue and customer counts between trial and control stores.
- Investigated drivers of change: whether increased sales were due to more customers or increased transactions per customer.
- Generated clear visualizations to support insights.
- Delivered final reports with actionable recommendations.
