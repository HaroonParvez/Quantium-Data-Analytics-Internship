# Quantium-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Internship
Data analysis project for the Quantium Virtual Internship on Forage.

Welcome to my internship project repository! This repository contains all the work completed during my remote internship at Quantium as a data analyst. The main focus was to analyze retail store sales data and provide actionable insights through data analytics and visualization.

## Project Overview

The internship project was divided into three main tasks:

- **Task 1: Data Cleaning and Exploration**  
  This phase involved thorough cleaning and preprocessing of the raw retail transaction data. Key steps included handling missing values, correcting data inconsistencies, and transforming variables to suitable formats. Additionally, exploratory data analysis was performed to uncover initial patterns, distributions, and insights, setting the foundation for the subsequent analytical tasks.

- **Task 2: Retail Analytics and Strategy**  
  The core analytics task focused on comparing trial stores with matched control stores over the trial period. This involved calculating key metrics such as total sales and total customers, identifying significant differences, and determining the drivers behind sales performance changes. The analysis provided actionable insights into customer behavior and store performance, informing strategic recommendations.

- **Task 3: Presentation Report**  
  The final task synthesized the analytical findings into a clear and compelling PowerPoint presentation. This report included concise summaries, visualizations consistent with best practices, and strategic recommendations aimed at supporting the clientâ€™s planning for the upcoming half year. The presentation was structured to communicate complex insights effectively to a non-technical audience.

## Key Outcomes

- Successfully cleaned and prepared the dataset for reliable analysis.  
- Identified statistically significant improvements in sales for trial stores during the trial period.  
- Determined the extent to which sales uplift was driven by increased customer counts versus changes in purchasing frequency.  
- Delivered a polished, client-ready report that communicates insights clearly and supports data-driven decision making.
