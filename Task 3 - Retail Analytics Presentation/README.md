# Task 3 â€“ Presentation

This task involved developing a concise, insights-driven presentation that summarized the analytical findings from **Task 1** and **Task 2**. The goal was to effectively communicate key trends, shopper behaviors, and the impact of in-store trials to stakeholders, particularly a Category Manager.

## Part 1: Chips Category Insights

This section draws from the customer segmentation and product performance analysis. It highlights how sales are influenced by customer demographics (e.g., lifestage and spending level), pack size preferences, and seasonal trends.

**Key insights include:**
- High total sales from Budget and Mainstream segments, especially older and midage shoppers.
- A preference for larger chip pack sizes among these demographics.
- Opportunities to boost sales through targeted promotions around high-traffic periods like Christmas.

## Part 2: Trial Store Evaluation

This section covers the evaluation of three trial stores compared against matched control stores, assessing the effectiveness of an in-store layout change.

**Key takeaways:**
- Stores 77 and 88 showed strong uplift in either customer count or transaction frequency.
- Store 86 did not show meaningful change compared to its control, warranting further investigation.
- The analysis supports the potential of store layout changes to influence shopper behavior when implemented consistently.

## Output

The final deliverables include:
- `Task3_Presentation.pdf`: PDF version for easy viewing.
- `Task3_Presentation.pptx`: Editable PowerPoint file.
