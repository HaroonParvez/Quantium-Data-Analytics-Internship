# Task 2: Trial vs Control Store Analysis

## Purpose  
Evaluate the impact of the trial on selected stores by comparing their performance with matched control stores during the trial period.

## Data  
- Source: QVI transaction dataset  
- Trial Period: 1 Feb 2019 â€“ 30 Apr 2019  

## Methodology  
- **Control Store Selection:**  
  Selected control stores based on highest Pearson correlation of store metrics with trial stores.  
- **Metrics Analyzed:**  
  - Total Sales Revenue  
  - Total Customers (unique loyalty card numbers)  
  - Total Transactions  
- **Comparisons:**  
  Calculated metrics for trial and control stores during pre-trial and trial periods, and computed percentage differences.  
- **Visualization:**  
  Bar plots to compare sales and customers across stores and periods.

## Findings  
- Significant sales differences observed in trial period for stores 77 and 88, less so for store 86.  
- Changes in total customers contributed more to sales differences than changes in purchase frequency per customer.  
- Pre-trial comparisons confirm baseline similarity between trial and control stores.

## Usage  
- Run provided scripts to reproduce analysis and visualizations.  
- Modify date ranges or stores list as needed.  

## Next Steps  
- Present results to stakeholders with clear visuals.  
- Conduct further statistical testing if needed.  
- Explore targeted marketing based on customer behavior insights.
