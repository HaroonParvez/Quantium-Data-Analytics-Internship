# Task 2: Trial Store vs Control Store Analysis

## Purpose  
Analyze the impact of the trial by comparing trial stores with their matched control stores (needed to be found during this analysis) during the trial period.

## Data  
- Source: QVI transaction dataset  
- Trial Period: 1 Feb 2019 â€“ 30 Apr 2019  

## Methodology  
- **Control Store Selection:**  
  Control stores were selected based on store metrics correlation or provided mappings.  
- **Metrics Analyzed:**  
  - Total Sales Revenue  
  - Total Customers (unique loyalty card numbers)  
  - Total Transactions  
- **Comparison:**  
  Metrics for trial and control stores calculated during the trial period. Percentage differences computed to assess changes.  
- **Visualization:**  
  Bar plots created to compare sales and customers between trial and control stores across the trial period. Additional monthly bar plots were used to understand temporal trends.

## Findings  
- Trial stores 77 and 88 showed significant sales increases compared to their controls during the trial period.  
- Increase in total customers was the primary driver of sales uplift, rather than purchase frequency per customer.  
- Trial store 86 showed less significant change, suggesting possible differences in trial execution or customer behavior.

## Usage  
- Run the provided scripts to reproduce the analysis and generate visualizations.  
- Visuals can be used to inform stakeholders and support strategic decision-making.  

## Next Steps  
- Prepare presentation materials summarizing the insights for the Category Manager.  
- Investigate trial implementation differences for stores with less impact (e.g., store 86).  
- Consider further analysis on customer segmentation and transaction patterns.
