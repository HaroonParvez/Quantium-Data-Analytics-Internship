# Task 2: Trial Store vs Control Store Analysis

This task investigates the impact of a retail trial by comparing trial stores against their matched control stores during the trial period. The goal is to assess how the trial influenced key store performance metrics and identify drivers of change.

### Data

- Source: QVI transaction dataset  
- Trial Period: 1 February 2019 to 30 April 2019  

### Analysis Approach

- **Control Store Selection:**  
  Control stores were identified by evaluating the correlation of store-level metrics or by using predefined store pairings to ensure valid comparisons.

- **Key Metrics:**  
  - Total Sales Revenue  
  - Total Customers (count of unique loyalty card numbers)  
  - Total Transactions  

- **Comparative Analysis:**  
  These metrics were aggregated for both trial and control stores within the trial period. Percentage differences between trial and control stores were calculated to quantify the trial’s effects.

- **Visualization:**  
  Bar plots were generated to compare total sales and customer counts between trial and control stores. Monthly bar charts provided insight into temporal trends throughout the trial period.

### Findings

- Trial stores 77 and 88 demonstrated statistically significant increases in sales relative to their controls during the trial period.  
- The primary driver of sales growth was an increase in the number of purchasing customers, rather than higher purchase frequency per customer.  
- Trial store 86 exhibited limited change, indicating potential differences in trial implementation or customer response.

### Outcome

The analysis offers a clear understanding of the trial’s impact on store performance, supporting data-driven recommendations for future strategic planning and operational adjustments.
